# Machine Learning

Have you ever noticed that if you watch any video on youtube, it automatically creates a related `playlist` sideby:

When you search a product on shopping website, it shows a `Bought together` column:

You also have observed the `SPAM` section of your email, how come some suspected emails automatically move to spam section:
It's all because of machine learning.

# What is Machine Learning

Machine learning is to make computer learn and act like humans. 
A ML system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever recieves new data, predicts the output for it.

# Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning

Example: We have Inputs and Output:

|Input 1|Input 2|Output|
|-------|-------|------|
|2|1|2|
|2|2|4|
|2|3|6|
|2|10|?|

In Traditional programming, we will provide:
**Data(Input):** Input 1, Input 2
**Program:** Input 1 * Input 2
and get: **Output**

In Machine Learning, we will provide:
**Data(Input):** Input 1, Input 2
**Output:** Output
and get **Program** and using the program genrate outputs from new data.
